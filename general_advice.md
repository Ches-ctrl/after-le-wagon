# General advice for Le Wagon grads 👩‍🎓

## Continuing to learn 🧑‍💻

This is a different goal to starting a company and just as valid. Here are some ideas.

## How to learn 🔏

Work on projects, or at least challenges. It's much more difficult to learn in the abstract when you don't have a defined reason to know something.

With with others. Reach out to others continuing their projects or start your own or join an open source community. You can learn from one another like you were during the bootcamp.
